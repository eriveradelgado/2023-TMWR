# Chapter Notes

## The Ames Housing Data

This chapter highlights the importance of performing exploratory data analysis(EDA) prior to engaging in more complex modeling.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
data("ames")
glimpse(ames)
```

Ames is a dataframe object with 74 columns and 2930 rows. I'll follow along to get more acquainted with the dataset.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=2}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, col = "white")+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ames$Sale_Price)))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(ames$Sale_Price)), color = "red", size = 2)
```

The authors then proceed to break the data down by neighborhoods.
